The data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV.


BRIEF

AvocadoGo asked to create a data visualization based on 3 years of avocado sales data in the United States. The main goals of the project are:
 • Track how avocado sales evolved over the years for both conventional and organic types.
 • Calculate average price and share of organic vs. conventional avocados.
 • Identify sales dynamics, including peaks and troughs throughout the years.
 • Compare sales performance across different regions to support decisions on purchasing, pricing, and marketing strategies.
 • Evaluate whether there is potential to increase marketing efforts for organic avocados.


APPROACH

 • Data cleaning and aggregation by year, region, and type.
 • Calculated key metrics (KPI): Total Volume (overall sales), Average Price, Share of Organic / Conventional
 • Created interactive visualizations in Tableau Public: KPI tiles for quick overview, Trend by Month to show sales dynamics, Breakdown by Region to identify high-performing markets
 • Filters allow exploring data by year(s) and type of avocado.
